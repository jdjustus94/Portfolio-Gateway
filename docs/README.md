My name is Josh and it's a pleasure to have you here! I am a Data Analyst, but I wasn't always. Prior to my start in data I was a retail manager for a local grocery store chain, but COVID-19 changed everything for me. Like many others my previous job was impacted with constant supply issues and fluctuating prices that made things difficult. Not just for my customers but my operations as well. Sales and profits were falling, and I saught a means to improve our situation with what I had on hand. 

It was here that I truly explored data as a means to rectify this dilemma. With only pdfs of product details (current and archived), Microsoft Excel, product sales, and my own proprietary knowledge of my store I found the means to attain my goals. That was the seed that lead to my interest in pursuing a career in data and my awakening on what data can do to help attain goals.
