## Here I present some snippets of various projects I've worked on.

#### Here is a sample of some SQL I did when querying a SuperStore data set:

Here is a query that answers how the quarterly sales and profits differed between years.

#### Another Sample of some SQL code for a Video Rental Store Project:

This is to answer some basic business questions on what movies are popular per genre category and which country provides the most business.

#### Last, and I've saved the best for it, is an interactive dashboard from a project I worked on. This dashboard utilizes hypothetical data from Sprocket Central provided by KPMG AU. The different visualizations are interactable and the drop down menus are functional. Feel free to play around and checkout the viz!
