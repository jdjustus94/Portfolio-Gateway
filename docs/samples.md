Last, and I've saved the best for it, is an interactive dashboard from a project I worked on. This dashboard utilizes hypothetical data from Sprocket Central provided by KPMG AU. The different visualizations are interactable and the drop down menus are functional. Feel free to play around and checkout the viz!
